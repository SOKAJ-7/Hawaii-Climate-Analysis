# Hawaii-Climate-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the viability of a 'Surf n' Shake' shop on the island of Oahu. This prospective shop is an ambition of mine (for the purposes of this analysis) and I need to convince a potential investor that this shop will succeed. The problem is that the investor has already lost an investment on a previous surf shop due to not accounting for poor weather in December and the resultant decrease of sales. The purpose of this project is to preform statistical analysis on the weather data from Hawaii dating back to 2010, and hopefully put the concerns of our investor to rest. To do this we will be using python and SQL lite to query and analyze our data.
